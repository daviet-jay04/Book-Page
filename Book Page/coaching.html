And if you can tell a compelling story, you can get our attention, and you can move us. You can move us to give attention to our families, to protect the environment, to buy a product, to save our own lives. I am a story writing coach who teaches you to tell stories that move. In a 4-week course called The Art of Writing Compelling Stories.</p>
                <h5 class="mb-6  text-accent lg:text-left md:text-center ss:text-2xl xx:text-xl">Course Objective:</h5>
                <p class="mb-6 font-medium  lg:text-lg text-secondary lg:text-left sm:text-base md:text-center">At the end of this Course, you would have learnt how to craft stories that grab the attention of your audience, sustain that attention, and communicate your message. In addition, you'll learn to give them something that remains with them a long time. In short, you would have learnt to leave lasting impressions on your reader, causing them to remember, spurring them to action.</p>
                <p class="mb-6 font-medium  lg:text-lg text-secondary lg:text-left sm:text-base md:text-center">At the end of this 4-week course, you'll be a better writer. You'll come to recognize just how good writers write. Your eyes will be opened to note what makes their writing so effective. It'll be like looking at a slice of cake and finally saying, “Hey, I know how you baked that!”</p>

        <p class="my-6 font-medium  ss:text-lg text-secondary text-left xx:text-base">As Bukola Adewuyi, a gifted student of the course, wisely observed: “I learnt that the basic tactic to present my message is with a STORY. Stories just have a way of keeping people hooked. No wonder I can spend a whole day reading a 428-page Christian fiction book and yet start yawning the moment I pick up a research article.”</p>
        <p class="my-6 font-medium  ss:text-lg text-secondary text-left xx:text-base">We love stories. We read them. We pay attention to them.

            <p class="mb-6 font-light text-secondary md:text-lg  dark:text-primary">Classes are arranged such that if a student is unable to attend class by 8 PM, he or she can go to the Course Page later, read up, and attempt the submissions. Questions, of course, will be attended to. And where a student needs more clarity, it will be provided.</p>
            <p class="mb-6 font-light text-secondary md:text-lg  dark:text-primary">After 4 weeks, students who have completed the course work (their writing submissions) will be certified. And mentorship follows from there. Mentorship means that students can continue to relate with the Coach, ask questions, seek her input, and count on her guidance in their writing journey.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">"I never knew I would need to sharpen my writing skills. It had never crossed my mind to take a writing class because I thought it was for only aspiring writers. That fateful week, Coach Brown reached out to me, because she felt led to send the information to me when the scholarship application was ongoing. I searched my heart, and I remembered that that same week I was to help my sister reply to her client. I noticed her choice of words and searched my heart again. Then I found out that I really needed to sharpen my writing and communication skills.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">The Course began February 12, 2024. My expectations were to learn the Art, Style and Discipline of writings that can pass an accurate and captivating information to my clients and mentees. And also to be able to communicate better with people, learning how to use the right expressions from my mind and thoughts. And also stun my world with beautiful write-ups. After the course: March 9, 2024. When she started this class with us, she began to introduce us to the elements of writing a story.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> From our Audience, to Attention, to Focus, to Emotions, Illustrations, Relatability, Finding a story, SMS method, CTA. Then she gave us submissions alongside to help us practice. At a point when I saw the submissions, I would faint and wake up again encouraging myself that I needed this skill. 😂 I am into the Fashion Business. And I discovered that this class was helping me also in paying attention to intrinsic details of my clients’ preferences. So, as the classes went on, I found out that it was helping me also to pay close attention to sketches and shapes.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">I know this has nothing to do with write-ups, but it did something to my sight. Along the line, I discovered that I used to have one passion that had been discarded for a long time — to write books and share my life experiences with stories. As we went deeper in the classes, the passion came back. Especially the day we were taught about 'Emotions'. There's one particular line I hold dearly from this class: Inside you is the most authentic story no one else can write. So I have decided not to hold all of these stories back to myself. No one is ever going to hear them until I write them out.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> When we started our LIRI journey, I realized how bad my sentence construction was. Thank God! I first wrote the chapter by pen in my book, then I typed it again. I knew it was a tedious work for me, but I had to do it that way. Because I know it will improve my writing. And it actually did! Doing my resubmissions, my eyes were following all the wrong things I had been doing in my write-ups, especially my punctuation marks. It was so bad. But now it has changed.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">Talking about being able to make write-ups that can stun my world, the cheat code I have been using for any write-up task is just to pay attention to the events around me. Writing it the way it played out! No emotions held back. I've found out that every day is a story! Thank you, Coach Brown Patience, for introducing me into this class. Thank you for pouring your all to see that we all attained the goals for which we signed up for this class. And not to discard this, thank you for being patient with us all.“Come and take all my flowers in the garden” like you normally say.",</p>

I make bold to see that my expectations have been met and surpassed.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">I say this because not only have I learnt to be a great storyteller, I've also been taught to *believe* in me and my message. Before I took the class, I was struggling with putting out the things I was writing. I just didn't see the need to share them with anyone. But now I know better.
